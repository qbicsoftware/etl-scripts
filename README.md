# ETL openBIS dropboxes

This repository holds a collection of Jython ETL (extract-transform-load) scripts that are used at QBiC that define the behaviour of openBIS dropboxes.
The ETL processes combine some quality control measures for incoming data and data transformation to facilitate the registration in openBIS.
